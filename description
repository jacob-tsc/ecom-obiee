Dear Dev, 

As per the plan laid out by tony , we have to collect all the information  on daily basis and save it locally in our premises.    for calculating different measures based on existing  KPI’s we will  convert this data into facts and dimensions  and publish this in our OBIEE dashboard.
what we need  from you is list out all the valid information’s from existing source’s. Plus the formula applied on it.
we will have  a virtual meeting on Sunday and you take us through the existing environment.
